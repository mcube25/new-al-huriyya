                    <p class='font-italic'><strong>Al-Hurriyah is a project manned by Muslim women who are passionate about Islam, children and individual/collective rights.  Over the years, they have seen and felt, cried and smiled, trusted and shared; its a jungle out there.
There are so many ills in the society, too much injustice and it is saddening. Individually, each feels that much can't be achieved in doing ones singular part for the society, so they decided it was time a body was set up for that purpose.
However, they don't want to do this alone, for the only reward is the Pleasure of Allaah (SWT). That is why they are sharing this venture with the public; especially those people who want to assist those in need and don't have the 'big bucks' to do so. They also feel that women and children are usually at the receiving end when any disaster happens...directly or indirectly.
This is the drive and all hope,all reward is with Allaah (Subhanahu Wa Taala), in shaa Allaah.</strong></p>
