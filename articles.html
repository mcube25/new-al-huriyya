                    <h3 class="state">Be Unique</h3>
                    <p>There is comfort in conformity, lying low and blending with the crowd. As a result, many a times, we let our world such as friends, family, television, workplaces, and all these other things define us. We keep borrowing appearances
                        and catch whatever appears to be the thing' of the season and run with it. This pretense does not get us anywhere. In fact it adds to stress as we become preoccupied with keeping up appearances and are saddled with the prospect
                        of never living up to our potentials.</p>
                    <p>Each and every person has a being created differently to fulfill a different role and purpose: Did you think that we had created you in play (without any purpose)Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ (Q23:115). What is your purpose? How do you find your uniqueness?</p>
                    <ul class="list-unstyled">
                        <li>Understand who you are</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We tend to underestimate the importance of knowing ourselves. Many of us go through each day reacting to events and just getting by rather than making conscious choices based on who we are and what we want. We are too busy with everything
                        else that in the end, suffocates the person inside. Self knowledge is the pillar of all values; without it, nothing else is genuine.</p>

                    <p>To know yourself</p>
                    <ul class="list-unstyled">
                        <li>Be aware of your strengths, weaknesses, values, likes and dislikes</li>
                        <li>Observe and be aware of your moods, reactions and responses to what is happening around you</li>
                        <li>Become aware of how these moods and emotions affect your state of mind</li>
                        <li>Examine how you interact with others</li>
                        <li>Observe how your environment affects you</li>
                        <p>Knowing and understanding yourself leads to better decision making, setting and reaching appropriate goals and altogether living more productively.</p>
                        <ul class="list-unstyled">
                            <li>Trust your intuition and instincts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Part of knowing who you are and expressing your uniqueness is trusting your intuition and instincts. We all have an inner gauge that guides us along our most fulfilling path. Look deep within to find the answers to your life. No
                            one is better at knowing what you need and want from life than you. Of course, it is prudent to listen to the advice of family, friends and professionals, but you are the ultimate authority on you. You are unique and original
                            and no one but you can make your decisions for you.</p>
                        <ul class="list-unstyled">
                            <li>Express yourself by cultivating your own style, tastes and personality.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There is absolutely no need to follow the crowd. Make your life an expression of who you are. Have the courage to follow your heart. This makes you more genuine, authentic, interesting and attractive to others. Let go of fear and
                            embrace your uniqueness. If you desire to be an Event Manager, don't settle for being an accountant because someone wants you to be, or because you can make more money at it. In the end you will lose out because the money won't
                            matter if you're unhappy, unmotivated or depressed.</p>
                        <ul class="list-unstyled">
                            <li>Believe in yourself and don't worry about what others think.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When you choose the right path for yourself, do not allow the opinions of others to distract you. People are good at offering well-intentioned, unsolicited opinions. However only you know what's best for you. Don't let a lack of
                            self-confidence or self-doubt prevent you from pursuing what you know is best for you. Let go of your personal insecurities. If you strive to be someone you're not, you will never be happy. Be yourself and be proud of who you
                            are. People who have a more positive view of themselves live better, healthier lives.</p>
                        <p>Take time with you and define yourself. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait for the world to define you. Dare to be unique, dare to be courageous, dare to be strong and vibrant, dare to be who you are, and be it the best way you know how and in
                            shaa Allaah, you will be on the path to realize the full potential of your unique skills and talents and enjoying the fullness of life.</p>
